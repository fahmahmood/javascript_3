# Chasing signals around your code

This workshop introduces you to more advanced computational thinking. Before this, you should have done:

- Some basic 'following the flow of information', e.g. understanding how a basic Ruby method takes an input and generates an output;
- Some intermediate 'following the flow' **across more than one technology**, e.g. understanding how a basic server takes an HTTP request and generates a response.

The high-level goal of this workshop is:

- Some advanced 'following the flow', e.g. understanding how:
  - a browser generates an AJAX request, 
  - passes it to a server as an HTTP request,
  - the server generates an HTTP response, and
  - the browser handles the HTTP response via JavaScript.

This workshop is 'more advanced' because we will need to track the flow of information across multiple technologies (HTML, JavaScript, Ruby) and platforms (Chrome, Request - Response, Sinatra).

## Instructions

You must come up with some way to demonstrate that they have internalised what AJAX is and how to follow it around the system. Some examples you could use:

- Build a basic Single Page App (SPA)
- TDD a simple AJAX page like the one in `src`
- Make a short video showing how an AJAX request-response cycle is handled at each stage of the cycle
- A short blog post detailing the process

> Any other ideas are good too - be inventive! You can work in any group size.
